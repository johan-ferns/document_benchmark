Further, among men with an apprenticeship certificate who experienced a decrease, the average decline was $17,800, larger than for any other group with education below the bachelor level.

First, as noted above, a large share of them experienced declines in employment income (56.0%); they typically worked in jobs that could not be done remotely. Second, the size of the benefit increases among those who received increased earning replacement benefits (+$7,884) was smaller than the size of employment income losses among those whose employment income decreased (-$17,800).\n",

In Alberta, men at every level of education, including those with a master's degree or doctorate, experienced employment income decreases, and the declines were broad-based across most fields of study. This was likely connected with provincewide economic challenges connected to the pandemic's impacts on the oil sector. In Newfoundland and Labrador, however, employment income declines for degree-holders were primarily attributable to large decreases in employment income (over $10,000, and 15% to 17%, among both women and men) among those with a degree in education, as elementary and secondary school teachers in this province experienced large earnings decreases.
