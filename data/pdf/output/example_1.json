      "data": "Changes in income across different levels of educational attainment \r\nduring the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic\r\nStatistics Canada – Catalogue no. 98-200-X, issue 2021015 3\r\nHighlights\r\n• On average, people with a bachelor’s degree or higher experienced increases in employment income \r\nfrom 2019 to 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, while those with education below the \r\nbachelor level experienced decreases during this period.\r\n• On average, increases in government earning replacement benefits—the Canada Emergency \r\nResponse Benefit (CERB) and related benefits, and Employment Insurance (EI)—more than offset \r\ndecreases in employment income for all groups, except men with an apprenticeship certificate. \r\n• By contrast with other provinces, on average, people in Alberta and in Newfoundland and Labrador \r\nwith a bachelor’s degree or higher experienced decreases in employment income.\r\nIntroduction\r\nJob losses associated with the pandemic particularly affected people in certain industries that typically have \r\nlower earnings, such as accommodation and food services and administrative and support services.1\r\n This raised \r\nconcerns about whether the pandemic worsened existing income disparities in Canada. Analyses of income data \r\nshowed that, while lower-income populations experienced larger employment income losses, these were offset \r\nby COVID-19 economic and recovery benefits and EI. This resulted in an overall reduction in income inequality in \r\n2020 compared with 2019.2\r\n \r\nA related question is whether the pandemic widened disparities between people with different levels of education. \r\nIn general, higher levels of education are associated with higher earnings.3\r\n Additionally, education level was \r\nassociated with job security during the pandemic. The Labour Force Survey showed that declines in the \r\nemployment rate from February to April 2020, during the first months of the pandemic, were larger among those \r\naged 25 to 64 with education below the bachelor level (11.7 percentage points), compared with those in the same \r\nage group who held a bachelor’s degree or higher (6.9 percentage points). The employment rates of those with \r\neducation below the bachelor level did not recover to pre-pandemic levels until fall 2021, compared with late 2020 \r\nfor those who held a bachelor’s degree or higher.4\r\nThese disparities are connected to differences in the types of jobs held by people with different levels of education. \r\nPeople with higher incomes and those with a bachelor’s degree or higher are more likely to work in industries \r\nwith high telework capacity, such as professional, scientific and technical services, that recovered rapidly from the \r\npandemic.5\r\n They are also more likely to work in “triple-protected” jobs—those that are permanent rather than term \r\nor casual positions; cannot easily be automated; and are pandemic resilient because they are suitable for remote \r\nwork, compatible with physical distancing or deemed essential by authorities.6\r\n By contrast, people with education \r\nbelow the bachelor level are more likely to work in sectors such as construction, retail trade, transportation and \r\nwarehousing, and accommodation and food services. These sectors are more dependent on in-person work and \r\ntherefore more affected by shutdowns and other policies such as physical distancing rules.7\r\nThe goal of this article is to build on the previous census findings about the effects of the pandemic on income \r\nequality by examining changes in income by detailed level of education and gender. It examines three types of \r\n1. Statistics Canada (2020b). Also see 2016 Census table 98-400-X2016364. \r\n2. Statistics Canada (2022). \r\n3. Statistics Canada (2017). \r\n4.

      "data": "Changes in income across different levels of educational attainment \r\nduring the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic\r\n4 Statistics Canada – Catalogue no. 98-200-X, issue 2021015\r\nincome: employment income; earning replacement benefits (namely, COVID-19 economic and recovery benefits \r\nand EI); and the combination of those two income types, referred to as labour market related income. It will provide \r\na clearer understanding of the changes in employment income for people with different levels of education and the \r\ndegree to which government benefits compensated for employment income losses. The 2021 Census data also \r\nprovide other information, such as people’s major field of study and province of residence, as well as whether they \r\nlive in an urban centre. This can shed further light on the relationship between education and income during the \r\nfirst year of the pandemic.\r\nThe target population for this article is people who were aged 25 to 64 at the time of the census in May 2021 and \r\nwho had non-zero employment income8\r\n in either 2019 or 2020. People who had employment income in 2019 but \r\nnone in 2020 (or, more rarely, vice versa) are therefore included, as declines in income experienced by those who \r\nwent from having some employment income before the pandemic to having none in 2020 are an important part \r\nof the income picture. Income figures for 2019 are adjusted for inflation and presented in 2020 constant dollars. \r\nEducation data and all other non-income variables are based on a person’s circumstances in May 2021; thus, \r\nfor a small proportion of the population who completed their credentials between 2019 and May 2021, their level \r\nof education in May 2021 will not describe their level of education in 2019. This is not expected to influence the \r\noverall patterns observed in the data.\r\nFrom 2019 to 2020, employment income increased for those with a bachelor’s \r\ndegree or higher, but decreased for those below that level of education\r\nThe effects of the pandemic on Canadians’ employment incomes had significant variations across different levels \r\nof education. On average, people with educational attainment below a bachelor’s degree experienced decreases \r\nin their average employment income, whereas those with a bachelor’s degree or higher saw increases. The \r\npattern was consistent across women and men (Chart 1).9\r\nIn general, people with the lowest levels of education had larger decreases in employment income, and those \r\nwith the highest levels of education had the largest increases. For example, people with no certificate, diploma or \r\ndegree or with high school as their highest level of education experienced larger declines in employment income \r\nthan those with a college credential or with a university certificate or diploma below the bachelor level. At the other \r\nend of the scale, the largest increases in employment income were among people with an earned doctorate, at \r\n$6,500 (+8.1%) for women and $6,900 (+6.6%) for men. \r\nHowever, the change in average employment income is an aggregate figure. At every level of education, some \r\npeople experienced decreases in employment income, while others experienced increases. People with lower \r\nlevels of education were more likely to experience decreases, accounting for much of the difference in the average \r\nemployment income change between educational groups. Employment income decreased for over half of people \r\nwhose highest level of education was no certificate, diploma or degree (56.1%) or a high school diploma or \r\nequivalency certificate (52.8%); nearly half (49.0%) of those with a college certificate or diploma; over two in five \r\n(42.2%) of those with a bachelor’s degree; and over one-third (35.1%) of those with an earned doctorate. \r\nThis is a strong indicator of the connection between educational attainment and job security during the pandemic, \r\nwhich is at least partly because people with higher levels of education were more able to work remotely. In May \r\n2021, over half (52.9%) of workers aged 25 to 64 with an earned doctorate were working from home,10 compared \r\nwith 39.4% of those with a bachelor’s degree; 22.7% of those with a college certificate or diploma; 15.5% of those \r\nwith high school as their highest level of education; and 8.8% of those with no certificate, diploma or degree. \r\n8. The term “non-zero” refers to positive or negative employment income. People who are self-employed may have negative net self￾employment income.\r\n9. For context on the number of people and share of the population with each level of education, see 2021 Census table 98-10-0384-01.\r\n10.People with an earned doctorate frequently worked in occupations that were compatible with remote work. For example, about one-quarter \r\nof workers aged 25 to 64 with an earned doctorate worked as university professors and lecturers (2021 Census, table 98-10-0403-01).",

Larger shares of men and women with an apprenticeship certificate experienced employment \r\nincome decreases (57.2% of women and 56.0% of men) than was the case at any other level of education. This is \r\nlikely because their jobs could rarely be done remotely; only 7.5% of people with an apprenticeship certificate were \r\nworking from home in May 2021, a smaller proportion than for any other level of education. Further, among men \r\nwith an apprenticeship certificate who experienced a decrease, the average decline was $17,800, larger than for \r\nany other group with education below the bachelor level. The magnitude of the decrease is likely attributable to the \r\nhigh pre-pandemic average earnings of men with an apprenticeship certificate ($69,700), which were higher than \r\nfor any other group of men or women with education below the bachelor level. A person with high wages who is \r\nout of work for a month will lose more than someone with low wages who is off work for the same amount of time. \r\nAmong those with a degree in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine or optometry, experiences varied widely. \r\nClose to half of men (48.3%) and women (46.8%) with this level of education experienced declines in employment \r\nincome, a larger share than for any other group with a bachelor’s degree or higher, as dentists’ and optometrists’ \r\noffices closed during parts of the pandemic, and some surgeries were cancelled. Conversely, the other half \r\nexperienced increases in employment income, possibly attributable to high demand for doctors during the \r\npandemic and/or to working overtime. Among those who experienced decreases in employment income, the drops \r\nwere particularly large (-$35,600 for men and -$26,800 for women). Among those who experienced increases, the \r\nrises were similarly large (+$36,000 for men and +$29,700 for women). In both cases, the changes were larger \r\nthan for people at any other education level.",

The differences by education level in the average increases in earning replacement benefits from \r\n2019 to 2020 were primarily attributable to the share of people at each level of education who received increased \r\nearning replacement benefits.

This was because \r\nhairdressing, culinary services such as restaurants, and performing arts were especially affected by the \r\npandemic—they involve a high degree of in-person contact.\r\nEmployment income decreases were larger and more widespread across \r\neducation levels in Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador\r\nWhile in most provinces the patterns of changes in employment income by level of education were similar to the \r\nnational pattern, there were some exceptions, especially in Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador. Previous \r\n2021 Census analyses found that these were the only two provinces where median household income declined \r\nfrom 2015 to 2020, connected not only with the pandemic but with lower oil prices during that period. Both \r\nprovinces are substantial oil producers, and oil prices fell to record lows during 2020 as much of global and \r\nnational travel and transport was restricted because of the pandemic.16\r\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the average employment income of people with a bachelor’s degree or higher declined in \r\nAlberta (-$2,100, or -2.1%, for men and -$900, or -1.4%, for women) and in Newfoundland and Labrador (-$900, \r\nor -1.0%, for men and -$800, or -1.2%, for women), in contrast to the increases seen nationally and in all other \r\nprovinces for people with this level of education. In Alberta, men at every level of education, including those with \r\na master’s degree or doctorate, experienced employment income decreases, and the declines were broad-based \r\nacross most fields of study. This was likely connected with provincewide economic challenges connected to the \r\npandemic’s impacts on the oil sector. In Newfoundland and Labrador, however, employment income declines for \r\ndegree-holders were primarily attributable to large decreases in employment income (over $10,000, and 15% to \r\n17%, among both women and men) among those with a degree in education, as elementary and secondary school \r\nteachers in this province experienced large earnings decreases. These declines were not attributable to periods of \r\nbeing off work, as they were seen among education degree holders who worked for the full year in 2020.\r\n12.Statistics Canada (2021d).\r\n13.Statistics Canada (2021c).\r\n14.Labour Force Survey, table 14-10-0416-01.\r\n15.2021 Census, table 98-10-0403-01.\r\n16.Meier, Batubenga and Garda (2021).",

This likely plays a role in the large employment income decreases of \r\nmen with an apprenticeship certificate at the national level: Alberta accounted for 11.7% of Canada’s population \r\naged 25 to 64, but for 19.9% of the men with an apprenticeship certificate in this age group. While men with an \r\napprenticeship certificate experienced average employment income declines of $4,100 (-5.9%) at the national \r\nlevel, decreases were larger in Newfoundland and Labrador (-$10,000, or -13.8%) and in Alberta (-$7,300, or \r\n-8.5%). \r\nMoreover, federal government transfers in the form of earning replacement benefits (such as the CERB) did not \r\noffset employment income losses in these two provinces as much as in the other provinces. At most levels of \r\neducation below a bachelor’s degree, men in Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador still experienced losses \r\nafter taking into account these benefits (i.e., experienced declines in net labour market related income). In Canada \r\noverall, this was only the case for men with an apprenticeship certificate. For Alberta in particular, this is in part \r\nbecause the main earning replacement benefit (the CERB) was set at a flat rate ($2,000 per month), and pre￾pandemic earnings at every level of education were higher in Alberta than in Canada overall.\r\nDeclines in income were more widespread among men living outside urban \r\ncentres, but the same was not the case for women\r\nExperiences also differed somewhat between men living in large urban centres (census metropolitan areas), in \r\nsmaller urban centres (census agglomerations) and outside urban centres. The changes in income by education \r\nlevel for men in large urban centres and for women in all three geographical categories were similar to those of \r\npeople in Canada overall. However, outside urban centres, men with a bachelor’s degree or an earned doctorate \r\nhad declines in average employment income. Moreover, in addition to the declines in labour market related income \r\namong men with an apprenticeship certificate, men outside urban centres with a college certificate or diploma, \r\na university certificate or diploma below the bachelor level, or an earned doctorate also experienced declines in \r\nlabour market related income. These findings may indicate that there were fewer options for remote work among \r\npeople living outside urban centres.\r\nConclusion\r\nThis article’s analyses support and expand upon previous findings that people with lower levels of education were \r\nmore likely to lose jobs and employment income during the COVID-19 pandemic. On average, people with levels \r\nof education below a bachelor’s degree had lower employment income in 2020 than in 2019, while those with a \r\nbachelor’s degree or higher saw increases in employment income. However, government benefits such as the \r\nCERB offset declines in employment income for all groups except men with an apprenticeship certificate.\r\nAdditional information\r\nAdditional analysis on changes in income during the COVID-19 pandemic can be found in the Census in Brief\r\narticle “The contribution of pandemic relief benefits to the incomes of Canadians in 2020” and the Daily article \r\n“Pandemic benefits cushion losses for low income earners and narrow income inequality – after-tax income grows \r\nacross Canada except in Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador.”\r\nAdditional information on changes in income from 2019 to 2020 in relation to educational characteristics can be \r\nfound in data tables.\r\nReference products are designed to help users make the most of 2021 Census data.

In these cases, individuals in the category “non-binary \r\npersons” are distributed into the other two gender categories. Unless otherwise indicated in the text, the category \r\n“men” includes men, as well as some non-binary persons, while the category “women” includes women, as well \r\nas some non-binary persons. For more information on the gender concept, see Filling the gaps: Information on \r\ngender in the 2021 Census.\r\nRandom rounding and percentage distributions: To ensure the confidentiality of responses collected for the \r\n2021 Census, a random rounding process is used to alter the values reported in individual cells. As a result, when \r\nthese data are summed or grouped, the total value may not match the sum of the individual values, since the total \r\nand subtotals are independently rounded. Similarly, percentage distributions, which are calculated on rounded \r\ndata, may not add up to 100%.\r\nDefinitions\r\nEmployment income: This consists of all income received as wages, salaries and commissions from paid \r\nemployment and net self-employment income from farm or non-farm unincorporated business or professional \r\npractice during the reference period. \r\nEarning replacement benefits: This refers to Employment Insurance in 2019, and in 2020 to Employment \r\nInsurance as well as the following federal COVID-19 benefits: the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, Canada \r\nEmergency Student Benefit, Canada Recovery Benefit, Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit and Canada \r\nRecovery Sickness Benefit.\r\nNet labour market related income: This refers to employment income plus earning replacement benefits.\r\nBachelor’s degree or higher: This includes bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees; degrees in medicine, \r\ndentistry, veterinary medicine and optometry; and university certificates and diplomas that have a bachelor’s \r\ndegree as a prerequisite.",
