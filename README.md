Explored the following links to install PaddlePaddle on a GPU :

https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/packages/stable/cu128/paddlepaddle-gpu/

https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/packages/stable/cu126/paddlepaddle-gpu/

Unfortunately it does not seem to provide helpful whls to get paddlepaddle-gpu to work with PaddleOCR v3.
